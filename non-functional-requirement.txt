Here is a comprehensive solution addressing the non-functional requirements and platform provisioning for your movie ticket booking platform:

1. Transactional Scenarios and Design Decisions

 Key Transactions:
  - Ticket Booking: Reserve seats and process payments atomically.
  - Show Creation/Update:Theatres managing show schedules.
  - Seat Inventory Management: Allocate, update seat availability upon booking or cancellation.

Design Decisions:
  - Use ACID-compliant relational databases for critical data consistency (e.g., bookings and seats).
  - Employ Spring’s @Transactional for methods managing seat booking and updating seat inventory, ensuring atomic commit or rollback.
  - Implement optimistic locking on seat and show inventory entities to prevent race conditions during concurrent bookings.
  - For integrated payments, treat booking and payment as a transactional saga  — if payment fails, roll back seat reservation.
  - Use idempotency tokens  in API endpoints to handle retries safely without duplicate charges or bookings.

2. Integration with Existing Theatre IT Systems, New Theatres & Localization

- Existing IT Integration:
  - Provide RESTful APIs  and webhooks for synchronization with legacy systems.
  - Support data adapters  to map external theatre data schemas to the platform format.
  - Support batch import/export  and scheduled async sync jobs over queues (Kafka/RabbitMQ) for scale.

-New Theatre Onboarding:
  - A self-service portal  or partner APIs for theatres to register/show creation/inventory management.
  - Validation and approval workflows to ensure data quality.

-Localization:
  - Store movie metadata and UI texts in a multi-language resource store (database or JSON files).
  - Design UI and APIs to request content and movie metadata in the preferred locale.
  - Support locale-aware date/time formatting, currency display, and input validation.

3. Scaling to Multiple Cities, Countries & Guaranteeing 99.99% Availability

-Microservices Architecture: Decompose into independent services (booking, inventory, payment, user, theatre management), enabling isolated scaling and deployments.

- Cloud-Native Deployment:
  - Use **container orchestration (Kubernetes/EKS) with autoscaling.
  - Deploy across multiple geographical cloud regions with failover support.

-Database Scaling:
  - Use*multi-region, multi-AZ databases  with replication and failover (e.g., Amazon Aurora global DB).
  - Employ read replicas  for read-heavy APIs (movie listings, show schedules).

-Caching:
  - Use distributed caches (Redis/Memcached) to reduce database load on static or semi-static data (movie/show info).

-Load Balancing & CDN:
  - Use global load balancers and CDNs to optimize traffic distribution and reduce latency.

-High Availability Design:
  - Design stateless services facilitating easy failover.
  - Implement **circuit breakers** and bulkheads to improve fault tolerance.
  - Continuous monitoring, alerting, and automated recovery play key roles.

4. Integration with Payment Gateways

  - Integrate with reputable payment providers like Stripe, Razorpay, or PayPal using their official SDKs.

  - Use tokenization for card details and never store sensitive payment info on your servers to maintain PCI compliance.

  -Implement asynchronous payment confirmation** via webhooks.

  -Support multiple payment methods localized for countries you operate.

  -Roll back seat reservations if payment fails or is cancelled.

5. Platform Monetization

  -Transaction Fee Model: Charge theatres a percentage or fixed fee per ticket sold through the platform.

  -Featured Listings & Ads: Pay-to-promote movies or theatres for visibility.

  -Subscription Services: Offer premium analytics and insights to theatres for a fee.

  -Dynamic Pricing & Offers:Partner with theatres for exclusive discounts or loyalty programs monetized via platform subscriptions or commissions.

6. Protection against OWASP Top 10 Threats

- Use Spring Security  with strong authentication and authorization policies.

- Validate and sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.

- Protect APIs with rate limiting, tokens (OAuth2/JWT), and CORS restrictions**.

- Secure communication over HTTPS  everywhere.

- Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities.

- Store passwords securely with bcrypt or stronger algorithms.

- Implement logging and monitoring for suspicious activities.

7. Platform Provisioning, Sizing & Release Requirements

-Provisioning:
  - Use Infrastructure-as-Code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation) for repeatable environment setups.
  - Provision compute clusters, databases, caches, load balancers, and network settings in tune with expected load.

- Sizing:
  - Start with smaller instances and autoscaling in place.
  - Use data from load testing to right-size databases (CPU, RAM, IOPS).
  - Monitor usage to scale horizontally (adding nodes) before scaling vertically (bigger hardware).

-Release Management:
  - Use CI/CD pipelines (e.g., Jenkins, GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) for automated builds, tests, and deployments.
  - Implement blue-green + canary deployments to minimize downtime and risk.
  - Maintain separate environments (dev, stage, production) with automated rollback on failures.
  - Perform load and security testing regularly as part of release cycles.

This design ensures your movie booking platform is resilient, scalable, easy to integrate, secure, and monetizable while being ready to serve a global audience with high availability. Let me know if you want detailed architectural diagrams or example CI/CD pipeline scripts!
