The OWASP Top 10 is a regularly updated list published by the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) that highlights the ten most important security risks to web applications.
It is a standard awareness document for developers and security professionals, guiding them on common vulnerabilities and how to prevent them.

Here’s the OWASP Top 10 (2021 version, still current as of 2025):

1. Broken Access Control**
- Users can access data or actions they shouldn’t (e.g., unauthorized data exposure, privilege escalation).

2.Cryptographic Failures  (Previously: Sensitive Data Exposure)
- Weaknesses in protecting sensitive data in transit or at rest (improper encryption, insecure protocols).

3.Injection
- Untrusted data sent to an interpreter (e.g., SQL, NoSQL, OS commands) is executed, leading to attacks like SQL injection.

4. Insecure Design
- Flawed business logic, lack of security controls, or design without threat modeling and secure patterns.

5. Security Misconfiguration
- Default settings, incomplete configurations, open cloud storage, or unnecessary features enabled.

6. Vulnerable and Outdated Components
- Use of components (libraries, frameworks) with known vulnerabilities or unsupported versions.

7. Identification and Authentication Failures
- Weak authentication, lack of MFA, brute force, and credential stuffing vulnerabilities.

8. Software and Data Integrity Failures
- Code and infrastructure that do not protect against integrity violations (e.g., unsigned updates, deserialization flaws).

9.Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
- Absence of, or ineffective, logging, detection, and monitoring of security events.

10. Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
- Web application fetches a remote resource based on user input without validation, allowing attackers to make unintended requests.

Why is this important?
All modern web applications should be reviewed against these risks, as they are the most common and impactful vulnerabilities seen in real-world breaches.
Regularly following OWASP Top 10 guidance helps you build more secure applications.
